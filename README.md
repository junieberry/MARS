# MARS (CIKM'24)

This is an official repository for our paper **"MARS: Matching Attribute-aware Representations for Text-based Sequential
Recommendation"** in CIKM'24.

## Overview

MARS is a text-based sequential recommendation framework that
effectively captures attribute-wise user/item interactions.

- Attribute-aware text encoding captures the fine-grained user
  preferences based on textual attributes of items.
- Attribute-wise interaction matching identifies the attribute-level
  preference of users.

## Getting Started

### Environment

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the required packages.

```
pytorch-lightning==2.3.3
transformers~=4.28.0
wandb
wonderwords
```

### Dataset

Dataset can downloaded from [HERE](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/).
Please download the 5-core dataset and metadata, and unzip it to the `dataset` folder.
Run `process.py` as follows:

```
python process.py --file_path path/to/dataset.json.gz --meta_file_path path/to/meta_dataset.json.gz --output_path dataset_name
```

### Training

Run the training script as follows:
```
python main.py --data_path dataset/Scientific_ours --bf16 --num_train_epochs 128 --warmup_steps 1000
```
